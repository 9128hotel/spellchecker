## Supported Versions

I currently only have the ability to keep the latest version up activly. If you find an issue with older version report it but be aware it might take a while to be updated.

| Version           | Supported          |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| latest            | :white_check_mark: |
| older versions    | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The best way would be to email me at mailto:lucybeyley@gmail.com. For now this will be the only method but as the project develops I will provide a better way.
